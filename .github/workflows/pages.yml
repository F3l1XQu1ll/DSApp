# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "dev" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "dev", "pages" ] # 'pages' for testing
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "dev" ]
